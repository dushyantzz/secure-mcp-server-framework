# Secure MCP Server

This project lets AI apps use your tools in a safe and simple way.

## The problem (in simple words)
- People want AI to do real work (call APIs, run small tasks, use company tools).
- But every time, they have to build custom code, add passwords, add logs, and make sure it’s safe.
- This is hard, slow, and easy to break. It can also be risky if inputs are not checked.

## How this project helps
- It uses a common “plug” (called MCP) so any AI app that understands MCP can use your tools without special code.
- It keeps things safe: it checks inputs, limits how often tools run, and records what happened.
- It remembers only what matters: it avoids dumping too much text to the AI, so it stays fast and low‑cost.
- It shows simple stats: how many times tools ran and how long they took.
- You can run it on your computer or a cloud that supports MCP.

That’s it—simple, safe, and ready to use with AI.
