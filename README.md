# Secure MCP Server Framework

A secure, context-optimized Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that makes it simple to expose safe, auditable tools to AI agents without bespoke glue code or risky execution paths.

## The problem
- Teams want AI agents to call internal tools, APIs, and workflows, but stitching custom wrappers, auth, and logging around each tool is fragile and time-consuming.
- Ad‑hoc servers often miss basic safeguards: input sanitization, rate limits, permission checks, or audit trails—leading to security and compliance risks.
- Context bloat and token overuse make agents slow and expensive; most setups don’t manage relevance, budgets, or eviction.

## How this solves it
- Uses the MCP standard so any compatible client can discover, invoke, and compose tools consistently—no bespoke adapters.
- Built‑in security primitives: sanitized inputs, per‑tool rate limits and timeouts, role/permission checks, and lightweight audit events.
- Context intelligence: session‑scoped memory with token budgets, priority eviction, and relevance utilities to keep prompts lean.
- Operational visibility: minimal metrics for requests, tool outcomes, durations, and anomalies so teams can monitor real usage.
- Cloud‑ready by design: a compact, dependency‑checked FastMCP server that you can run locally or deploy to a managed MCP platform.
